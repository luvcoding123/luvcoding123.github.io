    <h2>Addressing The Issue Of: Anti-Black Racism in Canada </h2>

      <img class="indeximage" src="assets/racism.jpg" alt="A protest against racism.">
    
    <div> <p id="welcome" >
      Canada’s four-hundred-year history of anti-Black racism is due to the effects of colonialism and slavery on the country’s population, especially on its Black community. Colonialism and slavery were justified with the backward ideology that Black people were at the bottom of a man-made ‘racial hierarchy,’ designed to oppress and subjugate those who were deemed ‘inferior’ (often people of colour). This ideology was reflected in Canada’s laws, politics, cultural and social systems, and in any other sector of society to keep Black people subjugated under their non-Black counterparts. Despite this harsh reality, Canada’s Black community persevered and resisted the oppression, resulting in the abolition of slavery in North America and around the world. Unfortunately, anti-Black racism and white supremacy continue to permeate different aspects of modern Canadian society - including the workplace, the education sector, and the healthcare sector.
